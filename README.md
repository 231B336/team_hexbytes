🎓 Smart Student Hub
📚 Background

Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements—including academic excellence, participation in co-curricular and extracurricular activities—remain scattered across departments or lost in paper-based records. Many institutions lack a centralized platform to document, track, and showcase a student’s complete profile, such as:

🏆 Conferences and workshops attended

🎖️ Certifications earned

🤝 Club activities and volunteering efforts

🏅 Competitions and academic contests

👩‍💼 Leadership roles and internships

🌱 Community service activities

This fragmentation limits institutional efficiency and prevents students from building a verified, dynamic portfolio for:

💼 Job applications

🎓 Higher education admissions

🛠️ Skill recognition

Additionally, during events like NAAC accreditation, the absence of consolidated data creates significant administrative challenges.

📝 Project Description
